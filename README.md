[Jupyter Ascending](https://github.com/untitled-ai/jupyter_ascending) lets you
edit Jupyter notebooks from your favorite editor, then instantly sync and
execute that code in the Jupyter notebook running in your browser.

This package adds a couple interactive commands and keyboard shortcuts for
syncing/executing with the jupyter_ascending Python package.
